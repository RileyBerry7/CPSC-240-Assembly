# CPSC-240-AS3-HuronsTriangles
This assignment reinforces data validation, parameter passing, and macro usage in x86 assembly. The program calculates a triangle's area using Huronâ€™s formula, with input validation and triangle verification handled in assembly. The project consists of C/C++ for high-level logic and multiple assembly modules for core computations.
